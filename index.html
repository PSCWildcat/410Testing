<h2>Who We Are </h2>
	<p>Liganson Games Inc is your humble hometown game dev studio. Based right here in Omaha, we love making deep and interactive stories that our players can get tons of hours out of without wringing out a full $70. Our dedication to the craft of making games really helps us push ourselves to make better and better games and reach out to larger publishers and entertainment companies for opportunities to work with licensed IPs and bring you the characters and worlds you love with our own unique twist!</p>

<h3>What We Do</h3>
	<p>We make a host of titles both original to our studio and through larger production studios. We love working with licensed IPs like Star Wars and being able to create stories in the vast universes we can get our hands on with already established licenses, making dramatic and fun-filled stories along the way!</p>

<h3>Community Activities</h3>
	<p>Once a month, we host a game jam for local developers either looking for employment or just looking for a place to show off their coding skills. All are welcome regardless of skill level. Anyone can learn something! We even take internships and love being able to use our platform to keep our talented developers in the Silicon Prairie. </p>
